x get a GUI for modifying constants
x make it follow a line instead of just being straight into the distance
* have it turn at random into the distance.
* get the GUI to write to a config file so we can save things
* should there be a tunnel factor here? If it bends enough you can't see around the corner?

* make it actually loop forever
* fade into the distance?
* better color palette
