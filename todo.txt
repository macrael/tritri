x get a GUI for modifying constants
x make it follow a line instead of just being straight into the distance
* have it turn at random into the distance.

	* noise() is a builtin. seems like we should be able to make it work
* get the GUI to write to a config file so we can save things
* should there be a tunnel factor here? If it bends enough you can't see around the corner?
	* gonna have to be better, tunnel isn't right, got to determine which circle should be visible
	* get controls to draw on top.
* make it actually loop forever
* fade into the distance?
* better color palette

* make things further away have greater radius?



How to make the tunnel turn in random directions?
	* the mountin function, midpoint displacement, could be the thing?, then we have to store it though.
	* it's a random walk function?
