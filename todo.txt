x get a GUI for modifying constants
* get the GUI to write to a config file so we can save things
* make it follow a line instead of just being straight into the distance
	* should there be a tunnel factor here? If it bends enough you can't see around the corner?
* make it actually loop forever
* fade into the distance?
* better color pallet

* make things further away have greater radius?
